# Clipboard Typer

I originally made this to win in every Type Racer lobby I joined. Unfortunately, my account was banned after the second race. :c

## How to Use

Once you have the required packages installed:

1. Run clipboard_typer.py to launch the application.
2. Take a screenshot of some text that you want to type at godspeed.
3. Configure the typing speed and start delay.
4. Watch it gooooooooooo!
